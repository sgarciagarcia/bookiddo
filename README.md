## Description
You want your child to read. It's that simple. But you do not find books that catch his/her attention.
...Or maybe, your child is a bookworm, and you love it! So you want to help him/her find new adventures and discover books specifically chosen based on what he/she likes the most.
Bookiddo can help you with that!
